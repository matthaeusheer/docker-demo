## 1. Pre-Workshop Preparations
### 1.1 Setup your Linux System
You will need a Linux OS System (Ubuntu 20.04 *highly* recommended!) running either natively or on a Virtual Machine (e.g. using https://www.virtualbox.org/).
To setup a VM, watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5MhydijWmc

### 1.2 Install Docker
**Install docker** the fast way ðŸš€
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```
This convenience script detects your distribution and installs docker and required dependencies (needs sudo access). It should have created a `docker` group already, so you just have to add your own user to it to be able to run `docker` commands without `sudo`
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Restart your system for the changes to take effect.  
**Test the installation** by running
```
docker run hello-world
```
and reading the output prompt.
To enable docker auto-completion in the shell, run
```
sudo curl \
    -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/1.29.2/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose \
    -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
```

If you run into issues, see official documentation at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/.
