# Task 2 - Working with a very simple Dockerfile

In this task we will check out a very simple Java project (a hello world printing class) and containerize it.  


**Build an image with the given Dockerfile**

**Run the image**

**Override the CMD by starting a container with a interactive shell**  

**Look around in the container, what is there**

**Start the Java application from _inside_ the container**

**Exit the running container**

**Remove exited containers**

**Remove unused images**
